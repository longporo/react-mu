# Course Project from Maynooth University
## CS353 Group Project
### Clubventory
In this course, we students form a group to develop an application to experience the SCRUM development process.

There are different roles in the project, developer, testing, SCRUM master, UI designer, etc. I played the developer role.

The project is a web application based on React and Material-UI. It is about inventory rental in clubs. The club members can upload, rent and return stuff in the club.
